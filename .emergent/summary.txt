The previous AI engineer initiated the development of The Apex Algorithmic Trader, an AI-driven forex trading bot. The work started with clarifying product requirements, where the user emphasized building an Ultimate Forex Trading AI Agent focused on high-accuracy intraday signals for forex and binary options, integrating open-source LLMs for sentiment, and self-improving capabilities via backtesting. The AI engineer formulated a comprehensive 5-phase plan, starting with the core trading engine and progressively adding AI brain integration, self-improvement, binary trading, and advanced features.

Initial implementation involved setting up the basic FastAPI backend and React frontend. A major challenge encountered was dependency management, specifically  installation issues and / compatibility errors, which required significant debugging and temporary simplification of the backend by removing heavy AI model imports to get the server to start. Currently, the backend API is responsive and delivers forex analysis data, but the technical indicator calculations are returning zero values, indicating a pending issue with the core trading logic. The frontend is accessible, and the last action was to verify the full system in the browser.

<product_requirements>
The core product requirement is to develop The Apex Algorithmic Trader, an unprecedented AI for market dominance, primarily focused on **Forex markets**, with an additional section for **high-frequency binary trading signals** for OTC markets. The system aims to overcome human trading limitations (speed, emotion, cognitive biases) through continuous learning and adaptation.

Key features include:
-   **Core AI Agent:** A trading bot (rather than just a website) that monitors, analyzes charts and data, and autonomously generates high-accuracy intraday signals (every minute or so) for forex pairs.
-   **Deep AI Integration:** AI will serve as the brain, making all decisions.
-   **Strategy & Indicators:** Utilize best of the best technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Williams %R, CCI, ADX, etc.) and strategies, drawing inspiration from top open-source bots like FreqTrade and AlgoBot.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Incorporate sentiment analysis using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for news and other textual data.
-   **Self-Improvement:** The bot must test and backtest every signal in real-time, assess its accuracy, and continuously improve its performance autonomously.
-   **Full-Stack Application:** A complete application encompassing libraries, historical forex pair data, and capabilities to manage and present trading insights.
-   **No API Keys:** The solution must rely on free, open-source data and AI services as no API keys are provided.
</product_requirements>

<current_work>
Currently, the basic infrastructure of the Ultimate Forex Trading AI Agent is established. The backend, built with FastAPI, is running and accessible. It successfully responds to the root endpoint () and the forex analysis endpoint (). The  endpoint is able to fetch and return real forex data, including the current price, open, high, low, and close values for symbols like EURUSD.

However, a critical aspect, the calculation of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), is not yet functional, as these values are currently hardcoded to  in the API response. Similarly, sentiment analysis is returning static neutral sentiment. This indicates that the core trading logic for generating actionable signals based on technical analysis and sentiment is incomplete or buggy.

During the setup, the AI engineer faced significant challenges with dependency compatibility (specifically  and ) and server startup issues, likely due to loading heavy AI models. To resolve these, the backend code was temporarily simplified by removing imports related to these heavy models, allowing the server to successfully start and respond to requests. The frontend is also confirmed to be served successfully, though its full functionality and display of the incomplete backend data are yet to be verified by opening the webpage. The overall system can fetch raw data, but its brain for analysis and signal generation is currently dormant.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the frontend loads correctly and then debug why technical indicators are returning 0.
